# WordPress-Template
Create a WordPress template that fetches weather data from a public API using async and await The dashboard should handle Loading states and gracefully deal with any errors like slow internet or server issues using Html, JavaScript, NodeJS and React for frontend development and MongoDB for backend Database.

Set up the environment:

Install Node.js and MongoDB on your system.
Set up a new WordPress installation or use an existing one.
Create a MongoDB database:

Start MongoDB service.
Create a new database for storing weather data. Let's name it weatherDB.
Frontend Development:

Create a WordPress theme or plugin to handle the frontend.
Use React for frontend development.
Backend Development:

Create a Node.js backend to fetch weather data from the public API and store it in MongoDB.
Use Express.js for building the backend API.
Database Schema:

Define the schema for storing weather data in MongoDB. It could have fields like city, temperature, humidity, etc.
Fetch Weather Data:

Write a function in Node.js to fetch weather data from a public API such as OpenWeatherMap.
Use async/await to handle asynchronous operations.
Handle Loading States and Errors:

Implement loading states to show a spinner or loading message while fetching data.
Gracefully handle errors like slow internet or server issues. Display error messages to the user.
Integrate Frontend with Backend:

Connect the frontend React application to the backend Node.js API.
Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.
Display Weather Data:

Once data is fetched from the API, display it on the WordPress template using React components.
You can show the weather data in a dashboard or any desired format.
Here's a simplified implementation:

Backend (Node.js with Express.js):

This is a basic implementation. You may need to customize it further based on your requirements, such as adding more features, handling more error cases, or improving the UI/UX. Also, remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.
